Test your fundamental knowledge of arithmetic operator to operand precedence with the following scenario.

Maria knows the formula for calculating degrees Celsius given a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is: subtract 32, then divide the number by 9/5; but she cannot find her calculator, so she decides to write a function to calculate it but it gives the wrong answer.

Can you help her?

You don't have to handle non-numerical inputs, all inputs will be numerical.

Example

Convert 50 degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius:

50°F = 10 °C.
*/
function fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit) {  
  return (fahrenheit - 32) / (9/5);  
}
