/*
Description:
By getting an array of numbers, you'll need to identify the multiples of 2 and 3.

Basics, when you get a multiple of 2, you must return a string "Well". When you get a multiple of 3, you must return a string "Done". And of course, when you get a multiple of 2 and 3, you must return "Well Done".

Ps. Numbers that do not correspond don't needs to add anything.

The output must be an array of strings.

Input Example [2,3,5,6] Output Exemple ["Well", "Done", "Well Done"]
